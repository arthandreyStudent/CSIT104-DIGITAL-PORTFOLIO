The background which has a water color brush and composed of mainly colors light blue, yellow, pink, and white represents my curiosity and also the inner calm within me. The yellow/orange circle represents the sun which symbolizes to me that there will always be a tomorrow for me to improve and progress myself one step further from yesterday. Overall, this is the wallpaper that I've made that symbolizes my personality/character! :)
